# Description

This directory contains the illustrations of the documentation in .odg format
and .pdf format for use in the LaTex file.

The .odg format can be edited in [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) 
Draw.

The [map.odg](./map.odg) file is the .odg version of the game map. This was 
helpful to visually identify the data to be entered into the
[shapes.h](../../Ardymo/shapes.h) file.
