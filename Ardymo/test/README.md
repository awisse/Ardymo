# Description

Unit tests for

1. The methods of the Vec class,

2. the rotate function in rotate.h,

3. the intersections in intersection.h,

4. the distance in intersection.h and

5. the collisions in intersection.h.

The graphical representation of the test cases is in *intersections.odg* and
*collisions.odg*.

Using Google Test for C++.

1. Install Google Test (`apt install googletest`)

2. `make`
