# Description

The program `rotate` prints out sinus and cosinus values for integer degrees
on the values in `rotate.h`. It can also compute the sum of two 2-dimensional
vectors after rotating the second around the point in the plane defined by 
the first.

Finally, it can compute the euclidian distance between the two points.

Mostly used for testing purposes.
