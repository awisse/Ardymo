# Description

## Instructions

The program `vecalg` 

1. can compute the distance between two coordinates (px, py) and (vx, vy),

2. compute the hypothenuse of (x, y)

3. print the cosinus and sinus of an angle <phi> given by the option `-p`.

4. print the angle of (vx, vy) rotated around (px, py) in degrees with respect
   to the vector (0, 1).

5. print the point obtained by a clockwise rotation of (vx, vy) around (px,
   py).

Mostly used for testing purposes. For instructions, `vecalg -h`.
